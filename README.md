# Password Generator

## Application
    - This application will return user a random password after password criteria is gathered through a series of prompts. 
   
    -The user will have the option to choose uppercase, lowercase, special, and or numeric characters as well as length. If no otion is selcted or the length is not within set range, the user will be asked to make a valid choice. 
    
    -Once all criteria is gathered, arrays of all the different acceptable options are pushed togeather and random selections are made, up to the users length.
    
    -The password is validated to have at least one character of each option before returned to the user. If the password does not include at least one character from each option, then a new password is generated to be verified again. 
    
    -Once the password is verified, the password is returned to the user though a window alert that also acts as a "start over" initiator.
